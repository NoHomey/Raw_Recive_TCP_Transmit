# raw-recive-tcp-transmit
Public repository for a school homework for the `Assembly programing practice` course in ***ELSYS (TUES) - Technological shcool "Electronic systems"***.

The task for the homework was to:

 1. establish comunication between `unix raw socket` and `posix tcp socket`;
 2. to create an IP sniffer that sniffs for a given IP and when a package from that IP is recived by the sniffer he sends a message to that IP. 

The code for the given homework is located in `Project` and in `Socket_Playground` is located the code that was used to play with the `Linux Sokcets API` to learn the basics of it. 

Homeworks was done by me @NoHomey and Ilyan Germanov @ILIYANGERMANOV.
